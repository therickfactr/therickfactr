- 💞️ ...looking -> 'collaborate'?... nothing... yet...
- 📫 ...reach me -> [`nqzyx@nqzyx.xyz`](mailto:nqzyx@nqzyx.xyz)... yeah... its a real address...
- ❓ ...ɳʠζƴᶍ -> there's a story... about a car I once owned and loved... sadly, its long gone... the license plate was `NQU-638` which morphed into `nqZyx [38]` and ultimately, `nqZyx`.
- 🤣 ...fun facts -> my profile pic started as a poster featuring yours truly from a 2007 [NHTSA](https://nhtsa.gov) *Share the Road with Motorcycles* campaign. A friend found this heavily-modified version of the poster somewhere on the web. I'e been using it for quite some time as my "anonymous" avatar 😉...
