I have been a software developer/engineer for a very long time -- more than 40 years. 

It all started in my college days in the late 1970's when programming languages were almost never cross-platform or, when they were, had specialized syntax on each platform. Programming language(s) changed very slowly -- only once every few years -- and any code needed for a solution was hand-written (i.e., there was no GitHub, NPM, NuGet, etc.) This was a far cry from today's world of software development. 

I was first paid to write software in 1980 or 1981 when I wrote a retail inventory program for a college professor who owned a boot store. The platform was a shiny new Apple IIe with 64KB of RAM and a 5-1/4" floppy disk drive that could store a whopping 110Kb (yes, KB, not MB!) of data. The code was all written in AppleSoft BASIC -- including custom indexed file management. I cannot remember how much I was paid for that code, but I had found my passion.

Now, I should say that I have never been a competitive programmer. I enjoy building things, especially when there are technical challenges of one wort or another. Occasionally, I like solving puzzles -- mostly 5x5 Sudoku and VERY hard crosswords. I have never been a big fan of competitive programming contests for whatever reason.

These days, I am approaching retirement. Among my 6 adult kiddos, 4 are professional software engineers. I never pushed them toward this profession. In fact, they all traveled unique paths to get here.

- My eldest was never degreed or even formally trained. He started writing code in a high school work-study program. That fed his already insatiable thirst for knowledge. To my knowledge, this one has never even considered any other profession. These days, he is a world-class open source engineer and visionary. He spent a number of years in the space industry. These days he's working on his own startup for a new game he's been pondering for a while.
- The youngest of the first four -- a Presidential Scholar in mathematics -- interned with Amazon, then went to work for a consulting agency, had a stint at Google and is now leading development for a small company. He is an accomplished technical and team lead... and has that same appetite for knowledge.
- "Dos de Quatro" (aka, "Two of Four" <g>... TNG fans will get it...) completed a degree in Spanish spending a few years studying abroad in South America. He taught high school Spanish for a number of years and became the head of his school's Language department... Then then decided to leave education, enroll in an intensive Code Camp with his sister (see below). He subsequently switched careers and has become an accomplished full-stack developer in the educational software space. Yep, you guessed it. Another one with the unquenchable thirst.
- After a few years adrift on the sea of self-discovery, my New-York-City-slicker daughter enrolled in the same intensive Code Camp with her brother, "Dos de Quatro". She is a talented full-stack developer specializing in data visualation and championing the causes of the un(der-)represented in the workplace. And again, always seeking new knowledge. Oh, this one might have missed a calling to the legal profession üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è...

My other two (younger) kids are not in the software engineering business.
- My youngest son (son #4, child #5) is installing commercial audio systems and on track to become a skilled audio engineer. He's constantly learning, gaining accreditations, and unstoppable in his drive for excellence.
- My younger daughter (daughter #2, child #6) is still searching for her calling in life... but she's always learning; always trying to find success... and she care about people in an extraordinary way. She's gonna change the world one day.

The one thing I can say for sure is that all 6 of my kids come by their life-long drive to learn honestly. In my mid-60's, I still feel the drive to learn something new every single day. In fact, I know that if I learned something today, I am still alive!

Each one of my kiddos makes me proud. All are far more more talented and skilled than I had ever hoped to be at their age... and who knows, maybe the remaining two youngest will follow in the footsteps of their older siblings someday. You never know...
