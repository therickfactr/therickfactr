I have been a software developer/engineer for a very long time -- more than 40 years. 

It all started in my college days in the late 1970's when programming languages were almost never cross-platform or, when they were, had specialized syntax on each platform. Programming language(s) changed very slowly -- only once every few years -- and any code needed for a solution was hand-written (i.e., there was no GitHub, NPM, NuGet, etc.) This was a far cry from today's world of software development. 

I was first paid to write software in 1980 or 1981 when I wrote a retail inventory program for a college professor who owned a boot store. The platform was a shiny new Apple IIe with 64KB of RAM and a 5-1/4" floppy disk drive that could store a whopping 110Kb (yes, KB, not MB!) of data. The code was all written in AppleSoft BASIC -- including custom indexed file management. I cannot remember how much I was paid for that code, but I had found my passion.

Now, I should say that I have never been a competitive programmer. I enjoy building things, especially when there are technical challenges of one wort or another. Occasionally, I like solving puzzles -- mostly 5x5 Sudoku and VERY hard crosswords. I have never been a big fan of competitive programming contests for whatever reason.

These days, I am approaching retirement. Among my 6 adult kiddos, 4 are professional software engineers. I never pushed them toward this profession. In fact, they all traveled unique paths to get here.

- My eldest was never degreed or even formally trained. He started writing code in a high school work-study program. That activated an insatiable appetite for knowledge. He's never even considered any other profession. These days, he is a world-class open source engineer and visionary. He spent a number of years in the space industry. These days he's working on his own startup for a game. 
- The youngest of the four -- a Presidential Scholar in mathematics -- interned with Amazon and then went to work for a consulting agency. He is now an accomplished technical and team lead.
- "Dos de Quatro" (aka, "Two of Four" <g>... wait for it...) completed a degree in Spanish spending a few years in South America studying abroad. He taught high school Spanish for few years and was became the head of his school's Language department... Then then decided to leave education, enroll in an intensive Code Camp with the next sibling (see below). He subsequently switched careers and has become an accomplished full-stack developer in the educational software space.
- After a few years adrift on the sea of self-discovery, my New York city-slicker daughter enrolled in the same intensive Code Camp with "Dos de Quatro". She has a talented full-stack developer specializing in data visualation and championing the causes of the un(der-)represented. This one might have missed a calling to the legal profession üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è...

Each one of them makes me proud. All are far more more talented and skilled than I had ever hoped to be at their age... and who knows, maybe the remaining two (youngest) siblings will follow in their footsteps someday. You never know...
